Build your presentation Structure
Importantly, before you start creating your data charts, you should plan your presentation structure. This will ensure your presentation answers the right questions.

Here is a template that we would use at Accenture to create a presentation. You need to download this template and populate slides 2-6.


For each slide, think about: 

Agenda - What will your presentation cover?
Project Recap - What are the key points from the brief?
Problem - What is the problem that you answer in this presentation?
The Analytics team - Who is on your team?
As a reminder from the earlier task - this includes: Andrew Fleming (Chief Technical Architect), Marcus Rompton (Senior Principle), and yourself!
Process - How did you complete your analysis?

Once you’ve populated slides 2-6 - complete the quick knowledge check to move onto the next step.

In the next step, we’ll review what you’ve included before we start charting.
