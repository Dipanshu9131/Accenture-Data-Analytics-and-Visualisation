Data cleaning is a common and very important task when working with data.

What you need to do:

First: Open the three data sets below

Second: Clean the data by:

removing rows that have values which are missing,
changing the data type of some values within a column, and
removing columns which are not relevant to this task.
Think about how each column might be relevant to the business question you’re investigating. If you can’t think of why a column may be useful, it may not be worth including it.
 

Your end result should be three cleaned data sets. 

If you get stuck, we’ll provide some guidance in the next step. But we encourage you to give it a go first!
